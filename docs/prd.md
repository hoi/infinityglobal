# Infinity Global Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish professional online presence for Infinity Global consulting services
- Generate qualified leads through clear call-to-action driving visitors to contact page
- Communicate company credibility through founder credentials and client portfolio
- Provide transparent legal framework (Terms, Privacy) for business operations
- Ensure accessible experience across all devices (mobile-first responsive design)

### Background Context

Infinity Global is an established software engineering consulting firm founded in 2009 by MIT graduate Hyon Lee (BS & MEng). Despite serving 20+ large enterprise clients and numerous boutique firms over 15 years, the company currently lacks a professional web presence at its domain (infinityglobalcorp.com). This creates a significant market disadvantage as potential clients increasingly rely on digital research before engaging consultants.

The website will serve as the primary digital storefront, communicating the company's end-to-end service offering—from brainstorming through deployment with 6-month post-deployment support. The focus is on conversion: guiding prospects to contact via phone (+1 617-460-4451) or email, rather than complex interactive features.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, professional, and conversion-focused experience that immediately establishes credibility for enterprise consulting services. The design should feel modern and sophisticated without being overly complex—balancing visual impact with fast load times. Primary user journey is simple: arrive → understand value proposition → contact company. Secondary journeys include learning about company history/credentials and reviewing legal policies.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Scroll-based storytelling**: Homepage uses vertical scroll to progressively reveal value proposition, services overview, and social proof
- **Minimal clicks to conversion**: CTA buttons prominently placed in header and throughout content to reduce friction to contact
- **Thumb-friendly mobile interactions**: All interactive elements (buttons, nav, links) sized for easy mobile tap targets (minimum 44x44px)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Footer provides secondary navigation and information without cluttering primary content areas

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Homepage** - Hero with value prop, services overview, client credibility indicators, CTA
2. **About Us** - Company story, founder background, service methodology, team expertise
3. **Contact Us** - Contact methods (phone/email with interactive links), physical address, optional contact form placeholder
4. **Terms of Service** - Legal terms in readable format
5. **Privacy Policy** - Privacy practices and data handling

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - Ensures the site is accessible to users with disabilities, including proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and semantic HTML structure. This is standard for professional business websites and reduces legal risk.

### Branding

- **Professional consulting aesthetic**: Clean, modern design with generous whitespace conveying expertise and trustworthiness
- **Color palette**: Likely blues/grays suggesting stability and professionalism (to be refined by UX Expert)
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif for readability across devices, professional serif for headings if appropriate
- **Logo integration**: Company logo (with and without text) from root directory prominently featured in header
- **Stock photography**: High-quality images showing collaboration, technology, diverse professionals to humanize the brand

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Desktop, tablet, and mobile devices via responsive web design. Mobile-first approach given increasing B2B research conducted on mobile devices. No native mobile apps required.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: **Monorepo**

Single repository containing all application code, assets, configuration, and deployment scripts. For a simple marketing website with no microservices or separate APIs, a monorepo provides simplicity and ease of deployment.

### Service Architecture

**Monolith** - Single Ruby on Rails application serving all pages via server-side rendering. No separate API services, no client-side JavaScript framework, no backend microservices.

**Tech Stack Details:**
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails (latest stable version, e.g., Rails 7.x)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for modern, utility-first responsive design
- **Templating**: Rails ERB templates (server-side rendering, no React/Vue/Angular)
- **Web Server**: Puma (Rails default, production-ready)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Propshaft or Sprockets for serving static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **Storage**: No database required (static content in views/partials)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Rails controller tests, view rendering tests, and integration tests covering critical user paths (navigation, contact links, responsive behavior).

**Testing Stack:**
- **Framework**: RSpec (Ruby testing standard) or Minitest (Rails default)
- **Integration**: Capybara for simulating user interactions
- **Coverage**: Focus on routing, view rendering, link functionality (tel:/mailto:), responsive breakpoints

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Deployment & Infrastructure:**
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose.yml for easy VM deployment
- **Port Configuration**: Use random unique port (e.g., 3847, 4721) defined in docker-compose.yml to avoid conflicts with other apps on shared VM
- **Environment Variables**: Store port, domain, and any secrets in `.env` file (excluded from git)
- **Web Server**: Nginx reverse proxy (optional, if VM requires it) or direct Puma access via unique port

**Asset Management:**
- **Logo Files**: Move logo and logo-with-name from root to `app/assets/images/` or `public/images/` directory
- **Stock Images**: Source from free stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels) or user-provided assets
- **Image Optimization**: Compress images for web to meet NFR6 (fast page load)

**Development Environment:**
- **Ruby Version**: Specify in `.ruby-version` or Gemfile (e.g., Ruby 3.2+)
- **Dependency Management**: Bundler for gem management
- **Local Development**: `rails server` on localhost, Docker Compose for production-like testing

**CI/CD (Optional but Recommended):**
- GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing on commits
- Automated Docker image build and push to registry
- Deployment script for VM (SSH + docker-compose pull/up)

**Security:**
- HTTPS required for production (Let's Encrypt certificate on VM)
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) configured in Rails
- No user input storage, so minimal security concerns beyond standard web hardening

- **Exemplary epic and story structure** with logical sequencing and appropriate sizing for AI agent execution
- **Outstanding technical guidance** providing all necessary constraints and decisions for architect
- **Clear functional requirements** that are testable and complete
- **Comprehensive non-functional requirements** covering performance, security, and deployment
- **Well-defined user experience goals** with accessibility and responsive design priorities

### Recommendations for Enhancement

**High Priority:**
1. Add specific success metrics to Goals section (e.g., qualified inquiries/month, page load targets, mobile traffic percentage)
2. Document out-of-scope features explicitly (blog, case studies, testimonials, contact form)

**Medium Priority:**
3. Brief competitive analysis of 3-5 consulting firm websites
4. Confirm analytics integration requirement

**Low Priority:**
5. Pin Ruby version for reproducibility
6. Add visual user journey diagram

### Technical Risks Identified

1. Mobile menu may require JavaScript despite server-side only preference
2. Docker port uniqueness needs verification process
3. SSL certificate setup may require VM sudo access
4. Legal content (Terms/Privacy) needs source or template service

### Final Assessment

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD provides sufficient detail and guidance for architectural design to begin. Minor enhancements recommended but non-blocking.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please create a comprehensive UI/UX design system and detailed screen specifications for the Infinity Global consulting website based on the PRD at `docs/prd.md`. Focus on:

1. **Visual Design System**: Define color palette (professional consulting aesthetic), typography scale, spacing system, and component library
2. **Detailed Screen Designs**: Create specifications for all 5 pages (Homepage with hero/services/credibility sections, About Us, Contact Us, Terms, Privacy)
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Document breakpoints and mobile/tablet/desktop layouts
4. **Component Specifications**: Header with mobile hamburger menu, footer, CTA buttons, navigation states
5. **Accessibility Guidelines**: WCAG AA compliance details, color contrast ratios, focus states

Output should include detailed design specifications that developers can implement directly, using TailwindCSS utility classes where possible.

### Architect Prompt

Please create a comprehensive technical architecture document for the Infinity Global consulting website based on the PRD at `docs/prd.md`. Your architecture should address:

1. **Application Structure**: Rails 7.x application organization, directory structure, key architectural decisions
2. **Technology Stack Implementation**: TailwindCSS integration approach, asset pipeline choice (Propshaft vs Sprockets), mobile menu solution
3. **Deployment Architecture**: Docker and docker-compose configuration, unique port management, environment variable strategy, SSL/HTTPS setup
4. **Testing Strategy**: RSpec/Minitest setup, controller and integration test structure, coverage goals
5. **Development Workflow**: Local development setup, Docker development environment, deployment process to VM
6. **Technical Decisions**: Document all key technical choices with rationale (mobile menu approach, image optimization strategy, legal content sourcing)

Output should provide implementation-ready technical specifications that development can begin immediately.
