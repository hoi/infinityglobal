# Story 4.5: Security Hardening and Production Deployment

## Status
Complete

## Story

**As a** website owner,
**I want** the site secured and ready for public production deployment,
**so that** I can confidently launch without security vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. HTTPS/SSL certificate configured (Let's Encrypt or VM-provided cert)
2. Rails security headers configured: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP
3. Environment variables properly secured (SECRET_KEY_BASE, any API keys in `.env`, not in git)
4. Production database config removed/disabled (confirm no DB credentials in codebase)
5. Docker Compose production configuration finalized (unique port, environment-specific settings)
6. Deployment documentation completed: VM setup instructions, Docker commands, environment variable setup
7. Application deployed to production VM and accessible via configured port
8. Manual smoke testing on production: all pages load, all links work, contact links function
9. Security scan run (basic vulnerability check, e.g., OWASP ZAP or similar)
10. Final QA checklist completed: all functional requirements (FR1-FR13) verified in production

## Dev Notes

### Rails Security Headers
In `config/environments/production.rb`:
```ruby
config.force_ssl = true  # Force HTTPS
config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
  'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN',
  'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff',
  'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security' => 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
}
```

### Environment Variables
Required in .env:
```
PORT=3847
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generate with `rails secret`>
RAILS_ENV=production
RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true
```

### Docker Compose Production
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "${PORT}:3000"
    environment:
      - RAILS_ENV=production
      - SECRET_KEY_BASE=${SECRET_KEY_BASE}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# On VM
git clone <repo>
cd infinityglobal
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### Security Scan Tools
- OWASP ZAP (free, open-source)
- Mozilla Observatory
- SecurityHeaders.com
- SSL Labs SSL Test

### Completion Notes List

**Rails Security Headers Configuration:**
- Enabled `config.force_ssl = true` in production.rb to force HTTPS
- Configured comprehensive security headers in production.rb:
  - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (prevents clickjacking)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (enables XSS protection)
  - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains (HSTS for 1 year)
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin (privacy protection)
  - Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=() (restrict browser features)

**Environment Variables Security:**
- Updated .env.example with comprehensive documentation
- Added RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true for Docker deployment
- Added detailed comments for all variables
- Added optional variables for logging, asset host, and host authorization
- Verified .env is in .gitignore (confirmed: .env excluded, .env.* excluded, .env.example allowed)
- No secrets in git history (fresh repository)

**Deployment Documentation:**
