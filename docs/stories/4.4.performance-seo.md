## Dev Notes

### Meta Tags
Add to `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:
```erb
<title><%= content_for(:title) || "Infinity Global - Expert Software Engineering Consulting" %></title>
<meta name="description" content="<%= content_for(:description) || "MIT-founded consulting delivering end-to-end software solutions since 2009" %>">
<meta property="og:title" content="<%= content_for(:title) || "Infinity Global" %>">
<meta property="og:description" content="<%= content_for(:description) || "Expert Software Engineering Consulting" %>">
<meta property="og:image" content="<%= image_url('logo-with-name.png') %>">
```

Then in each view:
```erb
<% content_for :title, "About Us - Infinity Global" %>
<% content_for :description, "Learn about Infinity Global's history and expertise" %>
```

### TailwindCSS Purge
In tailwind.config.js:
```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/views/**/*.html.erb',
    './app/helpers/**/*.rb',
    './app/javascript/**/*.js'
  ],
  // ...
}
```

### Robots.txt
```
# public/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://infinityglobalcorp.com/sitemap.xml
```
