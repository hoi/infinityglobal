## Story

**As a** website owner,
**I want** fast page loads and basic SEO optimization,

2. TailwindCSS purged of unused styles in production build
3. Rails asset pipeline configured for production (minification, compression)
4. Page meta tags added: title, description, keywords for each page
5. Open Graph tags added for social media sharing (og:title, og:description, og:image)
6. Structured data markup considered (schema.org for Organization, if appropriate)
7. Page load time measured and confirmed under 2 seconds (NFR6) on simulated 3G connection
8. Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights audit run, score above 90 for performance
9. Google Analytics or privacy-friendly alternative integrated (if user desires - confirm with stakeholder)
10. `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` configured for search engine indexing

## Dev Notes

### Meta Tags
Add to `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:
```erb
<title><%= content_for(:title) || "Infinity Global - Expert Software Engineering Consulting" %></title>
<meta name="description" content="<%= content_for(:description) || "MIT-founded consulting delivering end-to-end software solutions since 2009" %>">
<meta property="og:title" content="<%= content_for(:title) || "Infinity Global" %>">
<meta property="og:description" content="<%= content_for(:description) || "Expert Software Engineering Consulting" %>">
<meta property="og:image" content="<%= image_url('logo-with-name.png') %>">
```

Then in each view:
```erb
<% content_for :title, "About Us - Infinity Global" %>
<% content_for :description, "Learn about Infinity Global's history and expertise" %>
```

### TailwindCSS Purge
In tailwind.config.js:
```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/views/**/*.html.erb',
    './app/helpers/**/*.rb',
    './app/javascript/**/*.js'
  ],
  // ...
}
```

```
# public/robots.txt
