# Story 1.2: Shared Header with Navigation and CTA

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** site visitor,
**I want** a consistent header with navigation links and a prominent CTA button on every page,
**so that** I can easily navigate the site and quickly access the contact page.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Header partial (`app/views/shared/_header.html.erb`) created and included in application layout
2. Company logo displayed in header (placeholder image/text acceptable for this story)
3. Navigation menu includes links to: Home, About Us, Contact Us, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
4. Prominent CTA button labeled "Get Started" or "Contact Us" links to Contact page
5. Header uses TailwindCSS for styling with responsive design (mobile hamburger menu implemented)
6. Mobile hamburger menu toggles navigation visibility on click (simple JavaScript/Stimulus or pure CSS)
7. Header appears consistently on all pages via application layout
8. Active page highlighted in navigation (optional but recommended)

## Dev Notes

### Design Specifications (from front-end-spec.md)
- **Layout**: Fixed header at top of viewport with white background and shadow
- **Logo**: Left-aligned, height 32px (mobile) to 40px (desktop)
- **Navigation**: Center-right aligned links with 32px spacing
- **CTA Button**: Right-aligned, blue background (#2563eb), white text, rounded corners
- **Mobile Breakpoint**: 768px (md: prefix in TailwindCSS)
- **Hamburger Menu**: Top-right on mobile, triggers full-screen overlay

### TailwindCSS Classes Reference
- Fixed header: `fixed top-0 w-full bg-white shadow-md z-50`
- Container: `container mx-auto px-4 py-4`
- Navigation links: `text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-600 font-medium transition-colors`
- CTA button: `bg-blue-600 text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700`
- Mobile menu: `md:hidden` for hamburger, `hidden md:flex` for desktop nav

### Component Implementation
Reference the Header component specification in `docs/front-end-spec.md` Section 5.2.1 for complete ERB code example with TailwindCSS classes.

### Mobile Menu Solution
- Use vanilla JavaScript for simple toggle (no framework needed)
- Alternative: Stimulus controller for Rails integration
- Menu slides in from right on mobile, full-screen overlay

### Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- Verify header renders on all pages
- Test navigation links route correctly
- Test CTA button links to contact page
- Test mobile hamburger menu toggle functionality
- Test responsive breakpoints (mobile vs desktop layout)
- Verify active page highlighting works
