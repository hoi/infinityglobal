# Story 1.5: Basic Homepage with Deployment Validation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** project stakeholder,
**I want** a simple homepage deployed via Docker that displays basic company information,
**so that** I can validate the complete development-to-deployment pipeline works end-to-end.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Homepage controller and view created (`app/controllers/pages_controller.rb`, `app/views/pages/home.html.erb`)
3. Homepage displays: "Infinity Global" heading, tagline/subtitle, and placeholder content
4. Homepage includes header and footer via application layout
5. Homepage uses TailwindCSS for basic styling
6. Application deploys successfully via `docker-compose up` and homepage accessible at configured port
7. All links in header/footer navigate to appropriate routes (placeholder pages acceptable)
8. Manual testing confirms responsive design on mobile and desktop viewports

## Dev Notes

### Routing
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'pages#home'

  # Placeholder routes
  get 'about', to: 'pages#about'
  get 'contact', to: 'pages#contact'
  get 'terms', to: 'pages#terms'
  get 'privacy', to: 'pages#privacy'
end
```

### Controller
```ruby
# app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
  end

  def about
  end

  def contact
  end

  def terms
  end

  def privacy
  end
end
```

### Basic Homepage Content
- H1: "Infinity Global"
- Tagline: "Expert Software Engineering Consulting Since 2009"
- Placeholder paragraph about services
- Simple centered layout with TailwindCSS

### TailwindCSS Classes
- Container: `container mx-auto px-4 py-16`
- Heading: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4`
- Tagline: `text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6`

### Deployment Validation
This story validates the entire pipeline:
1. Rails app runs locally
2. TailwindCSS compiles and works
3. Header/footer components render
4. Docker build succeeds
5. Docker Compose deployment works
6. Application accessible via unique port
