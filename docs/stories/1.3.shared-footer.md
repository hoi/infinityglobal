## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** site visitor,
**I want** a consistent footer with contact information and links on every page,
**so that** I can access important information and legal pages from anywhere on the site.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Footer partial (`app/views/shared/_footer.html.erb`) created and included in application layout
2. Copyright notice displays: "© [Current Year] Infinity Global" (year generated dynamically)
3. Company contact information displayed: phone (+1 617-460-4451) with `tel:` link, email with `mailto:` link
4. Physical address displayed: "1309 Coffeen Avenue STE 1200, Sheridan, Wyoming 82801 USA"
5. Footer includes links to: About Us, Contact Us, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
6. Footer uses TailwindCSS for responsive layout (stacks vertically on mobile, horizontal sections on desktop)
7. Footer appears consistently on all pages via application layout
8. Footer styling complements header design (cohesive color scheme and typography)
