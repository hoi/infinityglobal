## Dev Notes

### Image Sources
- Unsplash.com - Free high-quality photos
- Pexels.com - Free stock photos
- Both have generous free licenses for commercial use

### Image Optimization
- Tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, Squoosh
- Target file sizes: < 150KB per image

### Lazy Loading
Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to images below the fold:
```erb
<%= image_tag 'about-team.jpg', alt: 'Team collaboration', loading: 'lazy', class: 'w-full rounded-lg' %>
```

### Accessibility
All images must have descriptive alt text:
- Hero: Describe the scene or leave empty if purely decorative
