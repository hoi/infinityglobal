# Story 4.6: Testing Suite and CI/CD Setup (Optional)

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated tests and CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** future changes can be deployed with confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. RSpec or Minitest test suite initialized
2. Controller tests written for all routes (homepage, about, contact, terms, privacy)
3. Integration tests cover critical user paths: Homepage â†’ Contact, navigation flow
4. View rendering tests confirm all pages render without errors
5. Tests verify tel: and mailto: links are correctly formatted
6. Responsive design tests validate mobile breakpoints (if using headless browser testing)
7. CI/CD pipeline configured (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar)
8. Pipeline runs tests on every commit/PR
9. Pipeline builds Docker image and optionally deploys to staging/production
10. Test coverage report generated (aim for >80% coverage)

**Note:** This story is marked optional because it may be considered beyond MVP scope. Recommend including for maintainability, but can be deferred if time/budget constrained.

## Dev Notes

### RSpec Setup
```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver' # for JS/responsive testing
end

group :test do
  gem 'simplecov', require: false
end
```

### Example Controller Test
```ruby
# spec/requests/pages_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Pages", type: :request do
  describe "GET /" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get root_path
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    end
  end

  describe "GET /about" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get about_path
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    end
  end
end
```

### Example Integration Test
```ruby
# spec/system/navigation_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Navigation", type: :system do
  it "allows user to navigate from homepage to contact" do
    visit root_path
    click_link "Get Started Today"
    expect(page).to have_current_path(contact_path)
    expect(page).to have_content("Contact Us")
  end
end
```

### GitHub Actions CI
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.3
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rspec
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build .
```

### Test Coverage
Use SimpleCov to track coverage:
```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start 'rails'
```

### Testing

**Test Requirements**:
- All controller tests pass
- Integration tests cover key user flows
- View tests confirm rendering
- Link tests verify correct formatting
- CI pipeline runs successfully
- Test coverage > 80%

**Test Files**:
- `spec/requests/pages_spec.rb` (controller tests)
- `spec/system/navigation_spec.rb` (integration tests)
- `spec/views/**/*_spec.rb` (view tests)
- `spec/helpers/**/*_spec.rb` (helper tests)
