# Story 3.5: Content Pages Integration and Navigation Testing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** site visitor,
**I want** to easily navigate to and between all content and legal pages,
**so that** I can find the information I need without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All navigation links tested: Home, About Us, Contact Us, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
2. Header navigation correctly highlights active page across all 5 pages
3. Footer links correctly navigate to all pages from any page
4. Manual testing confirms navigation flow: Homepage → About → Contact → Terms → Privacy → back to Home
5. All pages display correctly on mobile and desktop viewports
6. Breadcrumb trail or clear page identification helps users understand current location (optional but recommended)
7. 404 error page created for invalid routes (displays with header/footer, message, link back to homepage)
8. All pages load within acceptable time (under 2 seconds per NFR6)

## Dev Notes

### 404 Error Page
Create custom 404 error page:
- File: `public/404.html` (static) or custom error handling in Rails
- Include header and footer (may need to duplicate HTML for static file)
- Message: "Page Not Found"
- Link back to homepage
- Styled with TailwindCSS

### Active Link Helper
Ensure helper method works for all pages:
```ruby
def active_link_class(path)
  request.path == path ? 'text-blue-600 font-bold' : ''
end
```
