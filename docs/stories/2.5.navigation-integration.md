## Story

**As a** site visitor,

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All CTA buttons on homepage (hero, services, credibility sections) correctly link to `/contact` route
2. Header "Contact Us" nav link correctly navigates to Contact page
3. Header "Home" nav link correctly navigates to homepage from Contact page
4. Header CTA button ("Get Started"/"Contact Us") consistently links to Contact page from all pages
5. Footer "Contact Us" link correctly navigates to Contact page
6. All navigation links tested on mobile and desktop viewports
