tech stack:

ruby on rails with tailwindcss for modern-feel.  no need for database as these are static pages, and also no need for client app (ex. react app) and simply use rails templates.
deploymeny via docker-compose on a VM, but use a random, unique port number to avoid clash with other apps running on the same VM

emails should have mail to, and phone number should use tel links.

make the design mobile-friendly.
